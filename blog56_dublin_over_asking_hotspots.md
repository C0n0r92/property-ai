## Strategic Implications

### For Sellers Targeting Maximum Returns

Position properties in hotspot areas within the €300k-€450k price range to maximize over-asking potential. D22 and D11 demonstrate the strongest performance in this bracket, with 95%+ success rates and 14-16% premiums. Consider property type optimization within each hotspot, as terrace homes in D12 and D22 achieve the highest over-asking success.

### For Buyers Seeking Competitive Markets

Approach hotspot areas strategically, recognizing that 90%+ of properties sell above asking price. Focus on the €300k-€450k bracket in D22 and D11, where bidding competition is most intense. Consider properties slightly above your budget in these areas, as systematic over-asking premiums create opportunities for strategic bidding.

### For Investors Analyzing Market Efficiency

The hotspot phenomenon reveals market segmentation where suburban areas achieve superior pricing efficiency compared to premium districts. D12 and D22 demonstrate the strongest investment potential, combining high over-asking success with scalable property volumes.
