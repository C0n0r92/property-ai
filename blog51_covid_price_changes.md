The dramatic reduction in sub-€300k properties (from 21.8% to 7.3% market share) signals increased competition for affordable entry points. Early action on suitable properties remains critical.

**For Investors:**
The recovery's acceleration suggests strong rental demand potential. Areas like D3 and D15 showing 29%+ growth indicate robust capital appreciation and likely rental yield opportunities.

**For Upsizers:**
Mid-range properties (€500k-€700k) expanded from 16.8% to 27.0% of market share, providing increased selection for families seeking larger homes at competitive pricing.

## Market Maturity Indicators
The shift toward higher-value properties reflects market maturation, with luxury segments growing 69% while entry-level options contracted significantly.
