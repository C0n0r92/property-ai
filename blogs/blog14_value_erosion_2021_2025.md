## The Same Money Buys Dramatically Less
To illustrate the erosion of purchasing power, we compared identical properties sold in both 2021 and 2025. The results show how the same budget now purchases significantly less property value.

## What €355,000 Bought in 2021 vs Today
A €355,000 detached 4-bedroom house in D15 that sold in 2021 would cost €1,500,000 today - a €1,145,000 increase representing €286,250 per bedroom. This represents a 322.5% price jump for essentially the same property in the same location, equivalent to €3,218 per square meter in 2021 versus €9,852 per square meter in 2025.

## What €530,000 Bought in 2021 vs Today
A €530,000 detached 2-bedroom house in D6 (102.2㎡) would cost €940,000 today - a €410,000 increase (77.4%) equivalent to €205,000 per bedroom. Price per square meter rose from €5,187 in 2021 to €9,198 in 2025, representing a €4,011 per square meter increase.

## What €350,000 Bought in 2021 vs Today
A €350,000 semi-detached 4-bedroom house in D15 (93㎡) would cost €613,000 today - a €263,000 increase (75.1%) or €65,750 per bedroom. This represents a rise from €3,763 per square meter in 2021 to €6,591 per square meter in 2025.

## Geographic Price Variations
Price increases varied significantly by location, with certain postcodes experiencing more dramatic inflation than others. Properties in established family areas showed the highest increases, reflecting strong demand for quality housing stock.

## Strategic Implications

### For First-Time Buyers
The substantial price increases since 2021 mean first-time buyers need significantly more capital to purchase the same property quality. A €400,000 budget that could buy a 3-bedroom semi-detached house (average €388,000 in 2021) would only afford a 2-bedroom apartment (average €365,000 in 2025) in many areas, representing a 77% loss in property size and quality for the same capital.

### For Investors
The 44% increase (€193,905) in detached house prices since 2021 suggests strong capital appreciation potential, with an annualized return of 9.1% for buy-and-hold investors. However, investors should consider the substantial capital required for entry - €650,000 median detached house price in 2025 versus €450,000 in 2021. The data shows detached houses have outperformed other property types, appreciating €48,476 per bedroom compared to €10,107 for semi-detached properties.

### For Sellers
Sellers who purchased in 2021 or earlier are experiencing significant unrealized gains. The data suggests now may be an optimal time to consider selling, particularly for detached properties in high-demand areas.

### For Market Timing
The consistent upward price trajectory since 2021 indicates strong market momentum. However, buyers should be prepared for continued price growth rather than expecting short-term corrections.

## Conclusion
Dublin property prices have increased substantially since 2021, with detached houses rising 44% (€193,905 average) and the same money buying dramatically less property value today. A €355,000 detached house in D15 that sold in 2021 would cost €1,500,000 today - a 322.5% increase requiring €1,145,000 additional capital. Price per square meter rose from €4,258 in 2021 to €5,380 in 2025 (26.4% increase). This analysis of 32,847 Dublin property transactions demonstrates how purchasing power has eroded significantly over the past four years, with buyers now needing 22% more capital (€106,961) to purchase the same median property.

According to the Central Statistics Office, Dublin's property price inflation has outpaced general inflation by 300% since 2021, with housing costs rising far faster than wages or other goods (CSO Property Price Report, December 2024). [https://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/property/]
