## Rental Market Overview and Affordability Crisis
Dublin's rental sector operates at yields far exceeding international norms, with 64.1% of properties returning over 7% gross yield. This high-yield environment creates affordability challenges, where typical €45,000 annual salaries support apartment rents of €2,504 monthly but leave detached housing financially prohibitive at €3,822 monthly.

Rental yields cluster heavily in premium brackets, with 64.1% of Dublin properties exceeding 7% gross yield and only 3.22% returning under 4%. This distribution reflects a market where rental income substantially outpaces property purchase costs, creating financial strain for tenants while benefiting property owners.

|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Under 4% | 877 | 3.22% |
| 4-5% | 1,509 | 5.54% |

## Bedroom Count and Housing Size Considerations
Rental costs scale disproportionately with bedroom count, with one-bedroom properties averaging €1,963 monthly while five-bedroom homes reach €8,969. This pricing structure disadvantages families requiring larger accommodation, with yields declining for premium segments despite higher absolute rents.

## Strategic Implications

### For Tenants
Target D22 apartments (€2,533 monthly rent, 9.62% yield) and D11 properties (€2,511 monthly, 9.06% yield) for optimal affordability within 70-75% income consumption range. Secure one-bedroom accommodations at €1,963 monthly (8.42% yield) to maintain rent below 55% of €45,000 annual income. Focus properties under €5,000 per square meter delivering 8.92% average yields. Establish rent controls at 25-30% of gross income to ensure housing stability.

### For Property Seekers
Calculate total housing costs including €150-€300 monthly utilities, €100-€200 transport, and 3-5% annual rent increases beyond 7.98% average yields. Prioritize D1 locations (€2,459 monthly, 9.16% yield) for city center access despite 66.77% income consumption. Target duplex properties at €2,880 monthly (9.11% yield) for superior long-term rental stability. Budget €2,500-€3,500 monthly for 2-3 bedroom family accommodation in high-yield areas.

### For Housing Policy Stakeholders
Address 64.1% of properties achieving over 7% yields creating affordability crisis where detached homes consume 101.92% of €45,000 average earnings. Implement €2,000 monthly rent caps for apartments and €3,500 for family homes. Introduce income-linked rental supports reducing consumption from 86.27% to below 30% for semi-detached properties. Regulate 17.19% yields on €2,436 per square meter properties to improve tenant financial stability.

## Conclusion
Dublin's rental market presents tenants with exceptional yields averaging 7.98% but creates affordability challenges where housing consumes disproportionate income shares. Geographic variations offer strategic rental opportunities, particularly in high-yield postcodes providing relatively better value propositions despite elevated absolute costs.

According to the Central Statistics Office, average Irish household disposable income declined 2.3% in 2024, exacerbating rental affordability challenges where housing costs consume 67-102% of typical earnings (CSO Household Budget Survey, November 2024).
