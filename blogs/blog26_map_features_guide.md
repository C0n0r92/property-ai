## Pro Tips for Efficient Searching

**Use Quick Filters**: The pre-built categories (Family Homes, City Apartments, Investment Properties) combine multiple filter settings for faster searching.

**Check Planning Before Buying**: Properties with recent "Grant Permission" applications may have upcoming construction that affects value or livability.

**Compare Walkability Scores**: A property with 11/10 walkability in Dublin 7 may offer better lifestyle value than a larger property with 5/10 in outer suburbs.

**Set Multiple Alerts**: Create alerts for 2-3 adjacent postcodes to capture opportunities across your target area.

**Use Best Value Filter**: The "Best value only" toggle highlights properties priced 10%+ below comparable sales.
