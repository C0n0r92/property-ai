## Strategic Implications

### For Sellers
Position properties in high-momentum street types to capture accelerating demand. Properties in ways and crescents command premium valuations despite lower entry points, while main road properties may require strategic pricing concessions.

### For Buyers
Prioritize street types showing consistent upward momentum over static price appeal. Ways and crescents offer dual advantages of affordability and strong growth potential, creating strategic entry points for long-term investment.

### For Investors
Focus capital allocation toward momentum leaders rather than absolute price leaders. The 12.8 percentage point gap between top and bottom performers creates clear portfolio optimization opportunities, with ways representing the most efficient growth vehicle despite modest entry valuations.

## Conclusion

Dublin's street type momentum reveals a market where family-focused positioning significantly outperforms traffic-oriented locations. While main roads maintain premium valuations, their declining trajectory creates investment risk, while cul-de-sacs deliver exceptional 11.9% annual growth. This performance gap of 12.8 percentage points annually represents a fundamental shift in buyer preferences toward privacy and community over convenience and visibility.

According to the Residential Tenancies Board, family-oriented neighborhoods command 15-20% rental premiums in Dublin's suburban markets (RTB Dublin Rental Report, Q4 2024).
