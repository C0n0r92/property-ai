# The Investor's Yield Curve: How €300k Less Property Doubles Your Returns

## Executive Summary

Dublin's rental yield curve reveals a dramatic inverse relationship between property price and investment returns, with sub-€300k properties delivering 11.52% gross yields compared to 4.88% for €700k+ properties. This analysis examines the yield curve across Dublin's property market, identifying the "Duplex Paradox" where premium property types achieve both high yields and strong over-asking success rates.

## The Yield Curve Reality

Property investment returns in Dublin follow a clear inverse pattern: cheaper properties deliver significantly higher rental yields. Analysis of 27,236 properties with yield estimates reveals a 2.4x difference between the lowest and highest price brackets.

### Yield by Price Bracket

| Price Bracket | Properties | Avg Yield | Median Yield | Avg Price | Yield per €100k |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Under €300k | 3,906 | 11.52% | 10.49% | €255,431 | 4.5 |
| €300k-€400k | 7,172 | 9.04% | 8.91% | €349,238 | 2.6 |
| €400k-€500k | 6,241 | 7.83% | 7.59% | €444,079 | 1.8 |
| €500k-€700k | 6,087 | 6.57% | 6.44% | €579,621 | 1.1 |
| Over €700k | 3,830 | 4.88% | 4.89% | €1,050,699 | 0.5 |

This curve demonstrates that €300k less invested can double returns, with sub-€300k properties achieving yields 2.4 times higher than luxury €700k+ homes.
